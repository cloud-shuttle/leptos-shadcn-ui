   - `contract-testing` has dependency issues

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions (High Priority)**

1. **Fix Compilation Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Fix tailwind-rs-core test failures
   cargo test --package tailwind-rs-core --lib
   
   # Add missing dependencies to contract-testing
   cargo add anyhow chrono --package leptos-shadcn-contract-testing
   ```

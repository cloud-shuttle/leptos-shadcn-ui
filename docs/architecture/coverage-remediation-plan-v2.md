## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Test-Driven Development Approach

```rust
// Example test structure for each component:
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use leptos::*;
    use wasm_bindgen_test::*;
    
    // Basic functionality tests
    #[test]
    fn test_component_renders() {
        // Test basic rendering
    }
    
    // Variant tests
    #[test]
    fn test_all_variants() {
        // Test all component variants
    }
    
    // Accessibility tests
    #[test]
    fn test_accessibility_compliance() {
        // Test ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation
    }
    
    // Integration tests
    #[test]
    fn test_form_integration() {
        // Test form integration scenarios
    }
    
    // Performance tests
    #[test]
    fn test_performance_characteristics() {
        // Test render performance, memory usage
    }
    
    // Error handling tests
    #[test]
    fn test_error_scenarios() {
        // Test error boundaries, invalid props
    }
}
```

### 2. Coverage Monitoring

```bash
# Daily coverage checks
cargo llvm-cov --html --output-dir coverage/daily

# Weekly comprehensive analysis
cargo llvm-cov --html --output-dir coverage/weekly --workspace

# Coverage trend tracking
cargo llvm-cov --lcov --output-path coverage.lcov
```

### 3. Quality Gates

```yaml
# Coverage thresholds
component_implementation: 85%
signal_management: 80%
infrastructure_utilities: 75%
new_york_variants: 70%
overall_coverage: 90%
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Compilation Issues**: Maintain clean builds with daily checks
2. **Performance Regression**: Monitor bundle size and render times
3. **Test Flakiness**: Implement robust test infrastructure

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Focus on coverage targets, not feature additions
2. **Quality vs Speed**: Maintain test quality standards
3. **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize high-impact areas first

## Conclusion

This 4-week plan provides a structured approach to achieving 90%+ test coverage while creating production-ready examples that rival the quality of [Motion.dev's React examples](https://examples.motion.dev/react). The focus on component implementation, signal management, and infrastructure utilities will significantly improve our code quality and maintainability.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **Daily progress tracking** with coverage metrics
2. **Quality-first approach** with comprehensive test suites
3. **Example-driven development** with interactive demos
4. **Performance monitoring** throughout the process

**Expected Outcome**: A robust, well-tested component library with 90%+ coverage and production-ready examples that demonstrate the full capabilities of Leptos + ShadCN UI + tailwind-rs-core integration.

# 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Status**: 🚀 **READY FOR EXECUTION**

## 🎯 Overview

This roadmap provides a clear, actionable plan for transforming the leptos-shadcn-ui project from its current state (with 68+ compilation errors) to a production-ready component library. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring systematic progress toward a stable, high-quality codebase.

## 📋 Phase Summary

| Phase | Duration | Priority | Status | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Phase 1: Critical Build Fixes** | Week 1 | 🔴 Critical | 🚀 Ready | Zero compilation errors |
| **Phase 2: Implementation Completion** | Weeks 2-4 | 🟡 High | 📋 Planned | All stub code implemented |
| **Phase 3: Production Readiness** | Months 2-3 | 🟢 Medium | 📋 Planned | Production deployment |

  - Updated deprecated `create_signal` to `signal()`
  - Standardized callback patterns
  - Fixed trait bound issues
- **Success Criteria**: All components use consistent API patterns

### **Day 5: Dependency Cleanup**
- **Focus**: Clean up workspace and dependencies
- **Deliverables**:
  - Standardized Leptos versions
  - Removed unused dependencies
  - Clean workspace configuration
- **Success Criteria**: Clean `cargo check` across entire workspace

## 🔧 Phase 2: Implementation Completion (Weeks 2-4)

### **Week 2: Stub Code Implementation**
- **Focus**: Complete all `todo!` implementations
- **Deliverables**:
  - Bundle analysis functionality
  - Documentation generation
  - CLI command implementations
- **Success Criteria**: All stub code functional and tested

### **Week 3: Test Coverage Improvement**
- **Focus**: Achieve 90%+ test coverage
- **Deliverables**:
  - Component implementation tests
  - Signal management tests
  - Infrastructure utility tests
- **Success Criteria**: 90%+ coverage across all packages

### **Week 4: Tailwind Integration**
- **Focus**: Complete missing Tailwind features
- **Deliverables**:
  - Arbitrary value support
  - Dark mode variants
  - Animation system
- **Success Criteria**: 80%+ Tailwind CSS feature coverage

## 🏆 Phase 3: Production Readiness (Months 2-3)

### **Month 2: Performance Optimization**
- **Focus**: Bundle size and runtime optimization
- **Deliverables**:
  - Optimized bundle sizes
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Memory leak prevention
- **Success Criteria**: Production-grade performance metrics

### **Month 3: Documentation and Release**
- **Focus**: Production documentation and release preparation
- **Deliverables**:
  - Complete API documentation
  - Migration guides
  - Release preparation
- **Success Criteria**: Production-ready release

## 📊 Success Metrics

### **Phase 1 Metrics**
- ✅ **Zero compilation errors** across entire workspace
- ✅ **Zero type mismatch warnings**
- ✅ **Clean cargo check** output
- ✅ **All tests passing** for fixed components

### **Phase 2 Metrics**
- ✅ **All stub code implemented** and functional
- ✅ **90%+ test coverage** across all packages
- ✅ **80%+ Tailwind feature coverage**
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** for all features

### **Phase 3 Metrics**
- ✅ **Production-grade performance** benchmarks
- ✅ **Complete API documentation** with examples
- ✅ **Migration guides** for all breaking changes
- ✅ **Production deployment** ready

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **Build Complexity**: Start with simple fixes, test incrementally
- **API Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- **Performance Impact**: Benchmark before and after changes

### **Timeline Risks**
- **Scope Creep**: Focus on critical issues first
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize by impact and effort
- **Dependency Issues**: Test with multiple Rust versions

### **Quality Risks**
- **Regression Introduction**: Comprehensive testing at each phase
- **Documentation Drift**: Update docs with each change
- **User Impact**: Communicate changes clearly

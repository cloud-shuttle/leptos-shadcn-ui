# üö® Critical Remediation Plan - leptos-shadcn-ui

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: ‚ùå **NOT PRODUCTION READY** despite marketing claims.

Based on comprehensive staff engineer review, this repository requires significant remediation before it can be considered production-ready. The Oracle's analysis reveals major gaps between claims and reality.

## üîç Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Test Coverage Reality
- **Claim**: 100% test coverage, 300+ tests
- **Reality**: ~170 actual assertions, mostly `assert!(true)` placeholders
- **Impact**: No confidence in component functionality

### 2. Component Implementation Gaps  
- **Claim**: 46 production-ready components
- **Reality**: Only ~10 have substantial implementation, many are empty stubs
- **Impact**: Components will fail in real applications

### 3. Version & Dependency Issues
- **Current**: Leptos 0.8 (outdated for Sept 2025)
- **Latest**: Rust 1.90.0 (Sept 18, 2025), Leptos likely 0.9+ available
- **Impact**: Security and compatibility risks

### 4. File Size Violations
- **Issue**: Multiple files exceed 300 lines (up to 891 lines)
- **Impact**: Reduced testability and LLM comprehension
- **Files**: 19 files over limit, need immediate breakdown

### 5. Infrastructure Failures
- **CI Pipeline**: Many jobs never execute due to dependency issues
- **Performance Audit**: Binaries referenced don't exist
- **E2E Tests**: Not integrated into CI, mostly aspirational

## üìã Remediation Priority Matrix

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Immediate - 1 week)
1. [Fix Test Coverage Crisis](01-test-coverage-crisis.md)
2. [Update Dependencies to Latest](02-dependency-updates.md) 
3. [Break Down Large Files](03-file-size-remediation.md)
4. [Fix CI Pipeline](04-ci-pipeline-fixes.md)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (2-4 weeks)
5. [Complete Core Components](05-core-components.md)
6. [Implement Real API Contracts](06-api-contracts.md)
7. [Add Accessibility Testing](07-accessibility.md)
8. [Performance Audit Implementation](08-performance-audit.md)

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (4-6 weeks)
9. [Documentation Overhaul](09-documentation.md)
10. [Release Management](10-release-management.md)
11. [Security Audit](11-security.md)
12. [Cross-Browser Testing](12-cross-browser.md)

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete
- [ ] All tests have real assertions (no `assert!(true)`)
- [ ] All files under 300 lines
- [ ] Latest Rust 1.90.0 and Leptos 0.9+
- [ ] CI pipeline fully functional

### Phase 2 Complete  
- [ ] 10 core components fully implemented
- [ ] Real performance benchmarks passing
- [ ] Accessibility tests with axe-core
- [ ] API contracts enforced

### Phase 3 Complete
- [ ] Storybook/component catalog
- [ ] Semantic versioning automation
- [ ] Security scanning gates
- [ ] Cross-browser E2E tests

## üìä Resource Estimation

- **Total Effort**: ~200-300 person hours
- **Team Size**: 2-3 senior engineers + 1 designer
- **Timeline**: 6-8 weeks for full production readiness
- **Budget**: $50k-75k in engineering time

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Decision

**Current Recommendation**: **NO-GO** for production use.

**Path to Production**:
1. Complete Phase 1 fixes (critical)
2. Implement 10 core components properly (Phase 2)
3. Add comprehensive testing and documentation (Phase 3)

## Next Steps

1. Review individual remediation documents in this folder
2. Prioritize Phase 1 critical fixes
3. Assign ownership for each remediation item
4. Set up weekly progress reviews
5. Consider bringing in external audit team

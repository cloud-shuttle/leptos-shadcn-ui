# 🚨 Critical Remediation Plan

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This directory contains the comprehensive remediation plan for addressing critical build failures and implementation gaps in the leptos-shadcn-ui project. Based on the staff engineer review, we have identified **68+ compilation errors** and **significant implementation gaps** that must be addressed before production deployment.

## 📋 Remediation Structure

### **Phase 1: Critical Build Fixes (Week 1)**
- [Build System Remediation](./build-system-remediation.md) - Fix compilation errors
- [API Standardization Plan](./api-standardization.md) - Resolve type inconsistencies
- [Component Fixes](./component-fixes/) - Fix broken components

### **Phase 2: Implementation Completion (Weeks 2-4)**
- [Stub Implementation Plan](./stub-implementation.md) - Complete todo! implementations
- [Test Coverage Remediation](./test-coverage-remediation.md) - Achieve 90%+ coverage
- [Tailwind Integration Completion](./tailwind-integration.md) - Complete missing features

### **Phase 3: Production Readiness (Months 2-3)**
- [Performance Optimization](./performance-optimization.md) - Bundle size and runtime optimization
- [Documentation Updates](./documentation-updates.md) - Update all docs for production
- [Release Preparation](./release-preparation.md) - Final production readiness

## 🚨 Critical Issues Summary

| Issue | Severity | Impact | Timeline |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| 68+ Compilation Errors | 🔴 Critical | Blocks all builds | Week 1 |
| API Type Inconsistencies | 🔴 Critical | Runtime failures | Week 1 |
| Stub Implementations | 🟡 High | Missing features | Week 2-3 |
| Test Coverage Gaps | 🟡 High | Quality risk | Week 2-4 |
| Tailwind Feature Gaps | 🟡 Medium | Limited functionality | Month 2 |

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ **Zero compilation errors** across entire workspace
- ✅ **90%+ test coverage** for all components
- ✅ **All stub code implemented** and tested
- ✅ **API consistency** across all components
- ✅ **Production-ready builds** with optimized bundles

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start with [Build System Remediation](./build-system-remediation.md)** - This is the critical blocker
2. **Follow the component-specific fixes** in the `component-fixes/` directory
3. **Implement stub code** according to the implementation plan
4. **Achieve test coverage targets** as outlined in the coverage plan
